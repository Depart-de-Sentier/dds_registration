    - `extra_invoice_text`: Extra information they might want to add to the
      Invoice (help text is "Any additional text for the invoice, such as a
      reference or purchase order number").

    Form should display the name and address that we have for that user account.

    Users must be logged in, and registered for the event - otherwise they get
    redirected to the homepage.

    If they are registered, then they have chosen a RegistrationOption, so we
    can use that to look up the price and currency.
